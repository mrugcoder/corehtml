    <!-- 3rd Question -->

    <h1><font style="background-color: brown;">Short Notes on Tags</font></h1>
    <p>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph <br>
        The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange <br>
        The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just <br>
        The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</p>
        <br>
        
    <h1>Short notes on Elements </h1>    
    <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for creating web pages. It consists of various elements that structure and define the content within a web page. HTML elements are represented by tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets. These tags typically have an opening tag and a closing tag, with the content placed between them. </p>
    <br>

    <h1>Short Notes on Attribute</h1>
    <p>In HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), attributes provide additional information and characteristics to HTML elements. Attributes are added within the opening tag of an element and are specified using the attribute name and value. They help define how the element should behave or appear.</p>
    <br>
    <!-- 4th Question -->
    <h1><font style="background-color: aquamarine;">Tags</font></h1>
    <p><b>Anchor Tag:</b>The <a> HTML element (or anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>u tag:</b>The <u> HTML element represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, but may be altered using CSS.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Span Tag:</b>The <span> HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. <span> is very much like a <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element whereas a <span> is an inline-level element.</p>

    <h1>Nested Operators in Emmet</h1>
    <p>Child Selector (>): The child selector operator selects elements that are direct children of a parent element. It is denoted by the > symbol. For example, div > p selects all < p > elements that are direct children of <   div  > elements.</p>

        <p>Sibling Selector (+): The sibling selector operator selects elements that are adjacent siblings of a preceding element. It is denoted by the + symbol. For example, h2 + p selects the < p > element that follows immediately after an < h2  > element.</p>
        
        <p>Climb-up Selector (^): The climb-up selector operator selects an element's parent. It is denoted by the ^ symbol. For example, p ^ div selects the < div > element that is the parent of a < p > element.</p>
        
        <p>Multiplication Operator (*): The multiplication operator allows for creating multiple instances of an element or group of elements. It is denoted by the * symbol. For example, ul > li*3 generates three < li > elements inside a < ul > element.</p>
        
        <p>Grouping Operator (()): The grouping operator allows for grouping elements together. It is denoted by parentheses (). For example, div > (h2 + p) selects a < h2 > element followed by a < p > element that are direct children of a < div > element.</p>
        
        <p>ID and Class Combination: Nested operators can be combined with IDs and classes to create more specific selectors. For example, div#container > p.intro selects < p > elements with the class "intro" that are direct children of a < div > element with the ID "container".</p>
        
        <p>Nested operators in Emmet provide a concise and efficient way to express complex HTML structures and relationships. By combining these operators with IDs, classes, and element names, developers can generate nested HTML code quickly and easily, saving time and effort in the development process.< /p ></p>

        <h1>Self closing Tags</h1>
        <p>Self-closing tags, also known as void elements or empty elements, are HTML tags that do not require a closing tag. They represent elements that cannot have any content nested within them. Instead, they are self-contained and typically used for elements that do not have any meaningful content or do not require opening and closing tags to function correctly.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Meta Tags</h1>
        <p>Meta tags are snippets of code placed within the head section of an HTML document that provide information about the webpage to search engines and browsers. They serve as a form of metadata, offering concise descriptions and instructions to improve the visibility and understanding of a webpage. While their importance in search engine optimization (SEO) has diminished over the years, meta tags still play a role in organizing and presenting information about web content.</p>

            <p>There are several types of meta tags, each serving a specific purpose:</p>
            
            <p>Meta Description: This tag provides a brief summary or preview of the webpage's content. It often appears in search engine results pages (SERPs) as the snippet beneath the page title, influencing users' decision to click through.</p>
            
            <p>Title Tag: Although not technically a meta tag, the title tag is a crucial element for defining the page's title, which appears as the clickable headline in search results. It should be concise, relevant, and accurately represent the content of the webpage.</p>
            
            <p>Meta Keywords: Previously used to indicate the main keywords related to a page's content, this tag has lost significance for most search engines. Today, search engines primarily rely on content analysis to determine keyword relevance.</p>
            
            <p>Meta Robots: This tag instructs search engine crawlers on how to handle the webpage. It can indicate whether to index the page, follow links, or display the page in search results.</p>
            
            <p>Open Graph Meta Tags: These tags are specifically used for social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. They provide structured data about the webpage's title, description, image, and other relevant information when shared on these platforms.</p>
            
            <p>It's important to note that while meta tags can provide valuable information to search engines, they are not the sole determinant of a webpage's ranking. Search engines now place more emphasis on the overall content, relevance, user experience, and other factors. However, well-crafted meta tags can still contribute to the visibility and click-through rates of webpages in search results.</p>

            <!-- 10th Question -->

            <h1>Global Attributes</h1>

        <p>Global attributes are attributes that can be applied to most HTML elements. They provide common functionality and can be used across different types of elements. Here are five examples of global attributes:</p>

            <p>id: This attribute assigns a unique identifier to an element. It can be used to target and manipulate the element through CSS or JavaScript.</p>
            
            <p>class: The class attribute allows you to assign one or more class names to an element. Classes are commonly used to apply specific styles or to select elements using JavaScript or CSS.</p>
            
            <p>style: The style attribute enables you to apply inline CSS styles directly to an element. It allows you to specify individual style properties like color, font-size, padding, etc.</p>
            
            <p>title: The title attribute provides additional information about an element. It is typically displayed as a tooltip when a user hovers over the element, offering further clarification or description.</p>
            
            <p>data-*: The data-* attributes are used to store custom data within an HTML element. They allow developers to attach extra information to an element that can be accessed and manipulated using JavaScript.</p>
            
            <p>These global attributes can be applied to various HTML elements, such as < div>, < span>, < p>, < a>, < img>, and many others, making them versatile and widely applicable across different web development scenarios.</p>
